### Course Overview
Statistical models are necessary for analyzing the type of multivariate (often large) datasets that are usually encountered in data science and statistical science, and hierarchical models often play a vital role in many of those applications. This is a graduate-level course that introduces students to the building blocks of hierarchical modeling and provides students with the tools needed to build, fit and interpret hierarchical models.

Hierarchical or multilevel models provide a principled way to model naturally grouped or clustered data, in a way that takes advantage of the relationship between observations in the same group, but also allows for borrowing of information across the groups. In this course, you will be introduced to these models, with particular emphasis on the theoretical and conceptual foundations, as well as implementation, model fitting, and interpretation of the results.

This course emphasizes the mathematical theory behind hierarchical models, as well as real data analyses, including interpretation of results. All students must have the theoretical background covered in the prerequisites (in particular, in the context of Bayesian statistics) to be able to keep up with and understand the materials. 


### Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students should be able to

- Understand the foundations and general structure of both classical and Bayesian hierarchical models.
- Specify and fit hierarchical models to various types of grouped or clustered data.
- Use the models covered in class to analyze real data sets.
- Assess the adequacy of hierarchical models to any given data and make a decision on what to do in cases when certain models are not appropriate for a given dataset.

#### Playposit
To gain access to the pre-recorded lecture videos, you will have to create a Playposit account. There are participation quizzes embedded within the videos. These quizzes make up a part of your final grade (see: [course policies](https://sta-610l-s21.github.io/Course-Website/policies/}{course policies)) so take them seriously. To join the class on Playposit, you first need to create a new account as a student [here](https://www.playposit.com/join). Next, you will use the class link, which I will send out via email, to join the class site. While you need not create an account with your Duke email, I strongly suggest you do.

#### Zoom meetings
The easiest way for you to join the different Zoom meetings is to log in to Sakai, go to the "Zoom meetings" tab, and click "Upcoming Meetings". For the recordings (for lab and discussion sessions), also log in to Sakai, go to the "Zoom meetings" tab, and click "Cloud Recordings". Those will be available few minutes after the sessions.

### Materials

Lecture notes and slides, lab exercises and assigned readings will be posted on the course website, while lecture and lab videos will be posted on Sakai. White boards will also be used frequently in the lecture videos, so please pay special attention to those. Finally, we will closely follow the main text so students should make sure to always read the corresponding chapters in the assigned readings.

### Wellness day

In lieu of a traditional class meeting on April 12, 2021, please use our regular class time to engage in reflection and wellness endeavors. A list of wellness strategies and programs is available at https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/duwell/wellness-day-2021.

Although the goal of Wellness Day 2021 is to provide time and space to engage in activities that enhance your well-being, please remember that wellness isn’t achieved in one day.  Learning to balance your personal, professional, and academic commitments is a skill that should be practiced regularly and over time.
